<p>Python file that shuts down your computer when input te password you created. </p>
<p>This file creates a folder with 2 text files inside it</p>
<p>If the imports are not working for you or you dont have python installed just run the .exe file, it is not malicous</p>
<p>I just thought this would be a fun little project</p>
